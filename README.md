# DownIES
DownIES (IES - IORA Ecological Solutions) is a climate forecasting API that provides statistically downscaled data and climate variable analytics for minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall for Indian administrative boundries.

> Six GCMs and four downscaling Algorithms

> Time frames between **2015 and 2099**.

> **Monthly** and **yearly** time scales <br>
> (As there were inconsistencies in **daily** datasets for the region of India, it is yet to be made available!) 

<ins>DownIES tool provides:</ins>
1. Clipped Downscaled dataset for region (NetCDF).
2. Region mask (NetCDF)
3. Seasonal averages of climate variables (CSV)
4. Data analytics of climate variable analysis (PNG) 

In this project, we provide **seasonal** climate variable analytics for the state of Bihar from 2020 to 2099.

Please see How-to Guide on how to use this tool

We hope to expand this project to include other climate variables and provide climate variable analytics for even smaller regions such as cities and districs in India.
