# DownIES
DownIES (IES - IORA Ecological Solutions) is a climate forecasting API that provides statistically downscaled data for India and climate variable analytics for minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall for the selected region.

> Six GCMs and Four Downscaling Algorithms

> Time frames between **2015 and 2099**.

> **Monthly** and **yearly** time scales <br>
> (As there were inconsistencies in **daily** dataset for the region of India, this data is yet to be made available!) 

For this project, we provide **seasonal** climate variable analytics for the state of Bihar from 2020 to 2099. The dataset was downloaded and clipped for the Bihar region using a shapefile. (Please see folder **Visualization**).

Datasets from CarbonPlan's [CMIP6 Downscaling tool](https://github.com/carbonplan/cmip6-downscaling)

We hope to expand this project to include other climate variables and provide climate variable analytics for even smaller regions such as cities and districs in India.
