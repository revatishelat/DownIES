# DownIES
DownIES (IES - IORA Ecological Solutions) is a climate forecasting API that provides statistically downscaled global climate model data and climate variable analytics for minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall for Indian administrative boundries.

>Choose from:
>>Six GCMs and four downscaling algorithms <br>
>>Time frames between **2015 and 2099**.<br>
>> **Monthly** and **yearly** time scales <br>
>> (Due to inconsistencies in **daily** datasets for the region of India, these are yet to be made available in DownIES!) <br>

<ins>DownIES tool provides:</ins>
1. Clipped downscaled dataset for region (NetCDF)
2. Region mask (NetCDF)
3. Seasonal averages of climate variables (CSV)
4. Data analytics of climate variable analysis (PNG) 

In this project, we provide **seasonal** climate variable analytics for Bihar from 2020 to 2099.

Please see How-to Guide on how to use this tool!

Datasets are taken from CarbonPlan's [CMIP6 Downscaling tool](https://github.com/carbonplan/cmip6-downscaling). <br>

------
We hope to expand this project to include other climate variables and provide climate variable analytics for even smaller regions, i.e. cities, districts, and blocks, in India.
